    "text": "1 Introduction\nWorkplace burnout is a topic that’s gathering attention worldwide as a factor that can impact productivity and employees’ mental status. In Greece, the situation is no different, as employees face increasing demands and pressures in their work environment. To better understand burnout in this analysis, we will use the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OBI) as a validated measure that captures two critical dimensions of burnout: exhaustion and disengagement. In this study, we analyze responses from 617 Greek employees who had completed the OBI survey. By focusing on the patterns of exhaustion and engagement across different genders and age groups, we aim to discover meaningful insights in exmployees’ experience within these demographics. These findings can provide useful guidance for alternating work environments for the well-being of employees.",

    "text": "3.1 Technical Description\nThe dataset comprises responses from 617 Greek employees to the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OBI) survey. Each respondent’s burnout is assessed across two key dimensions: exhaustion and disengagement. The dataset includes variables that are either positively or negatively keyed, with higher scores on negatively keyed items indicating greater exhaustion or disengagement.\nTo facilitate analysis, we created two new variables: - Exhaustion Score: A composite score representing the exhaustion dimension, calculated by summing the responses to the negatively keyed questions (Q2, Q3, Q4, Q6, Q8, Q9, Q11, Q12). - Engagement Score: A composite score representing the engagement dimension, calculated by summing the responses to the positively keyed questions.\nAdditionally, we categorized the Age variable into four groups: - Below 25, 26-35, 36-45, and Above 45.\nThe data is provided in CSV format and imported using R for cleaning, transformation, and analysis.",

By focusing on two key dimensions—Exhaustion and Engagement—we explored the trends across gender and age groups. Here are the findings:\n\nGender Differences:\n\nThere were no significant differences in average Exhaustion or Engagement scores between genders.\nT-test proved our observation of the box plots, supporting the claim that there’s no significant difference between the two gender groups.\n\nAge Trends:\n\nExhaustion scores varied significantly across age groups, with noticeable peaks during early and late career stages. These patterns may reflect external stress sources, such as early career pressures or pre-retirement challenges.\nEngagement scores were generally stable but showed higher levels in younger age groups (specifically early 30s) and some fluctuations in older groups\n\nCombined Effects:\n\nInteraction plots again displays a lack of gender-based differences within most age groups. However, specific age ranges, such as late 20s and early 70s, exhibited distinct patterns, which can be a topic for further investigation.",
